## Objective

To find restaurants and good entertainment spots (Movie Theater) near station



## Project Overview

The datasets for this project was taken from **NYC Open Data**

  + NYC Subway Stations
  + NYC Restaurants
  + NYC Theaters
  
  
 The idea is to merge all these datasets and provide features similar to **Google maps** like finding subways,restaurants near station, theaters near station 

## The First Subway

```{r echo=FALSE, dpi=120}
# knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Sub#way/master/First_subway.jpg')


```


**Alfred Beach** constructed a Pneumatic transit line in 1869 also known as first New York Subway


## NYC Subway

```


 
## NYC Subway Dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}

#knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/slide1.JPG')

```

## NYC Restaurant Dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}

#knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/slide2.JPG')

```

## NYC Movie Theaters

## Conclusion & Next steps

* My project is a miniature version of Google maps using Shiny R.


* Demonstrates NYC subway to go from point A to point B with access to nearby Restaurants and Theaters.


* Increase scope of this project by adding Museums, Galleries, Parks, Clubs near station.
