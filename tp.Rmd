## The First Subway
```{r echo=FALSE, dpi=120}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/First_subway.jpg')

```




## NYC Subway

```{r echo=FALSE, dpi=120,cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/nyc.jpg')

```

## Main Idea 

The datasets for this project was taken from **NYC Open Data**

  + NYC Subway Stations
  + NYC Restaurants
  + NYC Theaters
  
  
 The idea is to merge all these datasets and provide features similar to **Google maps** like finding subways,restaurants near station, theaters near station 
 
## NYC Subway Dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/slide1.JPG')

```

## NYC Restaurant Dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/slide2.JPG')

```

## NYC Movie Theaters

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhadasuresh/MTA-Subway/master/slide3.JPG')

```
